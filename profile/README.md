It's like [Orwell: Ignorance is Strength](http://steamdb.info/app/633060/), but in real life. An application or an entire project that looks like an [OSINT](http://wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=OSINT), espionage or blackmail tool, but is actually just an **advanced notebook**, with "data-links" supported. Yea, like [evidence/investigation board](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_board) ([G Pics](http://google.com/search?q=investigation%20board&tbm=isch)), but in monitor.

Known references, theme-related or just interesting:

 - [Midnight Protocol](http://steamdb.info/app/1162700/)
 - [Song of Farca](http://steamdb.info/app/1435670/)
 - [Quadrilateral Cowboy](http://steamdb.info/app/240440/)
 - [SHENZHEN I/O](http://steamdb.info/app/504210/)

# Why?

Because I failing to remember:

- [x] people,
- [x] dates,
- [x] places,
- [x] and other unstructured human-specific data that ordinary people remember and use in everyday life. 

Yesâ€¦ [I forgor ðŸ’€](http://youtu.be/NwP4j_fnfQQ). Sounds funny, yea, haha.
